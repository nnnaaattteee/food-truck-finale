    <h3> About Us </h3>
        
      <p> What's so great about a mathmetician from the Middle Ages? Fibonacci created the greatest sequence of numbers in history, where each one equals the sum of the two numbers before it(1,1,2,3,5,8 - you get it). A thousand years since his death, people have noticed this sequence in nature, applied it in business and architecure, and created music inspired by its pattern. We think thats pretty cool <p>
      
     <p> For the last 3 years, Fibonacci's has served a sequence of good food to anyone who enjoys a nerdy pun. Now were expanding to bring you a food truck! Enjoy Fibonacci's at local events or book us for a neighborhood special occasion.
       
       <p> Fibonacci's is owned by Paula Delfino and inspired by her father Raul, a retired teacher who taught with great knowledge in the classroom and a wacky sense of humor <p>
